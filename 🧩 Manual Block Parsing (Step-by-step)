This section explains how to decode a raw Optimism block by hand, without code:

Convert the block number to hex (e.g., 10542300 → 0xA0E7AC)

Use eth_getBlockByNumber

From the result, manually identify:

parentHash

sha3Uncles

miner

stateRoot

transactionsRoot

receiptsRoot

logsBloom

gas values

Decode fields using base conversions:

baseFeePerGas → decimal Gwei

gasUsed → decimal

timestamp → readable date

Extract raw bytes (remove 0x, split in pairs)

Prepare them as RLP byte arrays

This gives beginners hands-on understanding of how an Optimism block is structured.
